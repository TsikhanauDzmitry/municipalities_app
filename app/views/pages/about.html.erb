    <h2>Project Concept</h2>
    <p>
      This application integrates the functionality of a classic To-Do app with features designed to address municipal-level challenges. It serves as a platform for city residents to submit requests for resolving various issues and for municipal workers to manage and execute these tasks efficiently.

    <h2>Development of the Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Initially, the application was designed as a simple To-Do list. Over time, it was adapted to meet the specific needs of municipal organizations. The result is a service that combines personal task management with advanced features for municipal use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application provides an intuitive interface for different user roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Residents:</strong> Focus on creating and tracking their requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Municipal Workers (Employees):</strong> Manage and execute tasks efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Oversee processes through a robust admin panel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The task was to build a to-do application that satisfies the minimum functionality requirements, including viewing, filtering, creating, editing, deleting, and completing to-do items. Instead of implementing a basic to-do application, I developed a more advanced <strong>Issue Management System</strong>, which not only meets but significantly enhances the required functionality.</p>
    <p>The Issue Management System is designed for use in a municipal context, allowing citizens to submit requests (issues) and enabling employees and administrators to manage and resolve them efficiently.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="mb-3">Fulfilled Requirements</h2>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">1. View a List of To-Do Items</h4>
      <p>Users can view a comprehensive list of <strong>issues</strong>, which are enhanced to-do items with additional attributes such as status and priority. The list can be filtered by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Users can filter issues by <em>open</em>, <em>in-progress</em>, <em>closed</em>, or view all.</li>
        <li><strong>Priority:</strong> Employees and administrators can prioritize issues based on urgency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Users can also search issues by <strong>title</strong> or associated users (creator or assigned worker), enabling intuitive navigation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">2. Create a New To-Do Item</h4>
      <p>Users, particularly residents, can create new issues with a title, description, and optional image attachment. Employees and administrators can create issues with additional options to set priority and status during the creation process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">3. Edit a To-Do Item</h4>
      <p>Issues can be edited to update critical attributes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Residents can modify the title, description, and attached images for issues they have created.</li>
        <li>Employees and administrators can update additional fields, such as status, priority, and assign issues to specific workers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">4. Delete a To-Do Item</h4>
      <p>Employees and administrators can delete issues when they are resolved or no longer relevant, maintaining a clean and focused issue list.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">5. Complete a To-Do Item</h4>
      <p>Issues can be marked as closed by updating their status. Employees can take ownership of issues by assigning them to themselves, updating the issueâ€™s status as they work on it, and marking it as completed when resolved.</p>
    </div>

  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="mb-3">Enhancements Beyond the Minimum Requirements</h2>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">1. Role-Based Access Control</h4>
      <p>Users are categorized into three roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Residents:</strong> Create and view the issues they submit.</li>
        <li><strong>Employees:</strong> Manage issues by updating their status, priority, and assigning themselves tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Have full control over all issues and access to an admin panel for managing system data.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">2. Dynamic Filtering and Sorting</h4>
      <p>Advanced filtering options allow users to refine issue lists based on their status and priority. Sorting options enable users to order issues by title, creation date, status, or priority.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">3. Pagination</h4>
      <p>The issue list is paginated using <strong>Kaminari</strong>, ensuring efficient performance and a clean user interface, even with a large number of issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">4. Clean and Responsive UI</h4>
      <p>The application uses Bootstrap for styling, providing a responsive and visually appealing interface. Buttons for actions such as "View," "Edit," and "Delete" are clearly styled and easy to use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h4 class="mb-2">5. Search Functionality</h4>
      <p>A robust search bar allows users to find issues based on title or the email of the creator or assigned worker, offering a highly user-friendly experience.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This enhanced implementation transforms a standard to-do application into a robust Issue Management System tailored for municipal services. It not only fulfills all specified requirements but also introduces additional features to improve usability, scalability, and relevance for real-world use cases.</p>
    <p>The system demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to handling tasks and requests, providing both citizens and municipal employees with a powerful tool for efficient issue resolution.</p>
